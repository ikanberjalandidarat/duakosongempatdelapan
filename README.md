# [2048] Merge style game 

Essentially use hammer js: //cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/hammer.js/1.0.6/hammer.min.js

Overall: HTML, JavaScript and SCSS (I will add in the compiled version)

Main concept: merge the same type of numbers into a higher type, and so on until the 2048 tile (biggest maximum tile)
